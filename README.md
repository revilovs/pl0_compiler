# pl0_compiler
This is a compiler for the [PL/0 language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0), which I am constructing for the course [Compiler/ Interpreter](http://www.informatik.htw-dresden.de/~beck/Compiler/) at [HTW Dresden](https://www.htw-dresden.de/startseite.html).

It uses the rather uncommon graph based approach of a parser, as taught in the course at HTW.

It does not generate machine code, it generates a byte code that works with the virtual machine supplied in the course.

The grammar implemented has one minor difference to the actual PL/0 grammar: It does not permit *statement* to be empty.

## Requirements
This project uses Java 8 and maven. If you don't have maven, you can also compile with javac.

## Building
To build the compiler, run
```bash
mvn package
```
This runs all tests and generates an executable jar file. If you don't have maven installed, you can also use `javac`.

## Running
You can run the compiler by executing
```
java -jar path/to/jar <source file> [<output file>]
```

## API Reference
The API reference can be generated by running
```bash
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```
The generated docs can then be found under `target/site/apidocs`

## Testing
You can run the tests with
```bash
mvn test
```

## Grammar
The implemented grammar is described by syntax graphs, which are implemented in the class `de.htw_dresden.informatik.s75924.parser.Graph`. These are their visual representations:
